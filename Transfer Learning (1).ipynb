After VGG-16 network without FC layers, don't use FC layers, use conv layers only as Fully connected layer. any FC layer can be converted to a CONV layer. This conversion will reduce the No of Trainable parameters in FC layers. For example, an FC layer with K=4096 that is looking at some input volume of size 7×7×512 can be equivalently expressed as a CONV layer with F=7,P=0,S=1,K=4096. In other words, we are setting the filter size to be exactly the size of the input volume, and hence the output will simply be 1×1×4096 since only a single depth column “fits” across the input volume, giving identical result as the initial FC layer. You can refer <a href='http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#convert'>this</a> link to better understanding of using Conv layer in place of fully connected layers.\n","3.
